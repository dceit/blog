title: ISSessionsCTF - "In The Bin" - GraphQL, JWT, Request Smuggling
---

### Introduction & Discovery
I'm writing this post as the ISSessions 2025 CTF comes to its conclusion. There were many great challenges worth writing about, but this write-up will be focused on my solution and first-blood to the KPMG sponsored challenge, `"In The Bin"`. I found this challenge to be the most unique out of the bunch.

The description is vague, just a reference to authentication tokens and a link to check out. Visiting the URL greets you with a fairly stereotypical corporate website design for all your construction container needs.

As always, I poked around the website, looking at the HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and HTTP response headers for any interesting information which may help narrow down potential vulnerabilities. From this, I came across two links on the website with GraphQL and API documentation.

I wasn't sure if this documentation was complete, so I performed additional directory enumeration which yielded two more hidden endpoints responding with 403 on GET requests.
1. `/flag`
2. `/protected`

Maybe once we figure out the authentication issues, we can revisit this.

### Investigating GraphQL
I've only submitted two bugs at this point related to breaking GraphQL implementations, so I'm still quite new to it all. I referenced some queries on [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/graphql.html), using introspection to discover schema information with which gave me the following to work with:

{% highlight javascript %}
{
	"__schema": {
		"types": [{
			"fields": [{
				"name": "endpointInfo"
			}, {
				"name": "randomFact"
			}, {
				"name": "secretHint"
			}],
			"name": "Query"
		}, {
			"fields": [{
				"name": "jwtConfig"
			}, {
				"name": "generateToken"
			}, {
				"name": "debugLog"
			}, {
				"name": "generateKey"
			}],
			"name": "Mutation"
		}
		/* ... removed large portion of the response for clarity ... */
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

This indicated to me that some of the "available queries" such as `passwordReset` and `loginActivity` were not actually available for usage. The most interesting of the bunch was `debugLog`, so I crafted the following HTTP request to be sent to the GraphQL endpoint.

{% highlight http %}
POST /graphql HTTP/1.1
Host: issessionsctf-web-kpmg.chals.io
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 57

{
  "query": "mutation { debugLog(level: \"INFO\") }"
}
{% endhighlight %}

![Debug Log Result](https://i.imgur.com/zLutIWt.png)
The result of this request was huge, including things such as debugging information, authentication information, and general logging. Going over this information my eye was caught by this base64 string highlighted in the image above. Decoding the string gave me the following plaintext:

{% highlight graphql %}
mutation { jwtConfig(key: "SECRET_REQUEST")}
{% endhighlight %}

Of course, I had to run this to see what it gives me:
![Secret request???](https://i.imgur.com/EIiDj3y.png)

Bingo! This looks like a secret key for signing their JWT tokens... Time to learn more about the authentication mentioned in the description.

### Investigating the API and tokens
I tested all the API endpoints, all except one returned the status of 404 with the message `"Route to /${path} is not found"`. Out of the list, `/auth/tokens` was the only one which responded to a GET or POST request. Here is what the result of that looked like.
![TOKENS!](https://i.imgur.com/PV9CAY2.png)

The tokens appear to be broken or expired, with the bottom one belonging to an admin account. The signature of this token includes an `&` symbol which is not valid base64.

From the hint at the start of the JSON response, I decided to try and fix this token by re-signing it with my newly obtained key from the JWT config. [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) is a great resource for modifying JWT tokens, so that is what I used.

If you recall from the very start, there is still those pesky `/flag` and `/protected` endpoints which required authentication. I set my newly crafted token using the `Authorization` header, and tried again.

`/flag` returned the following. It appears that it will only accept requests which are coming from the server which this is running on.

`/protected` on the other hand returned a hint, something about smuggling happening with the containers.

Embarrasingly to admit, I initally thought this may have been a reference to steganography and "smuggling secrets" from the images found on the homepage. I then came to learn that this was not the case, this message is a reference to [HTTP request smuggling attacks](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling).

### Smuggling!
The plan of action is to send a smuggling request to `/protected`, and tricking the server into giving us the response to `/flag`. This part was quite tedious as when you send an invalid request, the webserver will restart and give you a new private key for the JWT token. After quite a bit of time tweaking headers such as content length & trying different options like GET / POST to `/flag`, I was able to craft this payload. As the `/flag` endpoint is expecting a request from `localhost`, I specificed this in the `Host` header of the smuggled request.

{% highlight http %}
POST /protected HTTP/1.1
Host: issessionsctf-web-kpmg.chals.io
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwidXNlciI6ImFkbWluIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.Sr-OG-sOYCvuA_cLAas2R5I3onI_csZ9sNKPrwJtmF0
Content-Length: 215

GET /flag HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwidXNlciI6ImFkbWluIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.Sr-OG-sOYCvuA_cLAas2R5I3onI_csZ9sNKPrwJtmF0
{% endhighlight %}

![FLAG FOUND!](https://i.imgur.com/E8cIWXt.png)

There, we got the flag, along with first-blood on the challenge! `bhbureauctf{Sh1pp3d_4nd_D3l1v3r3d_Succ3ssfu11y___}`

I didn't dive too deep into how an HTTP request smuggling attack works. If you are interested in learning more about this rare attack vector, [here is the post written by p4k03n4t0r which I used as reference when creating my payload.](https://github.com/p4k03n4t0r/http-request-smuggling)


### Autosolver by SK
Generously "sk" from the ISSessions CTF Discord wrote a great auto-solver script for the challenge after I shared my solution. I'd like to give a [shoutout to his GitHub](https://github.com/shivakaushal) for this.
